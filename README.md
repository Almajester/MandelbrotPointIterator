A Java/Processing application allowing one to iterate a point explicitly
using the Mandelbrot set iteration, to interactively watch the convergence
or divergence of a set/non-set point beneath the mouse.

Based on code-demo from a Numberphile video showing iterative orbits, with
the same functionality
